Estimate of person-hours for completing the project

Using the agile methodology, we assigned the documentation 3 story points, the easy and hard AI 5 story points, the medium AI 3 story points. The ASCII animations was estimated to be 8 story points. The total story points would be 24.

Each sprint in our group would be in 60 minute increments, and each story point would take about 2 sprints. So the total would be 24 points x 2 sprint/point x 60 mins = 2880 minutes, or 48 person/hours total.
